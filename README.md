This is a simple JavaScript code tool that can use JSPacker to encrypt and decrypt, or obfuscate code.<br>
Confusing code using APIs is faster, but if you input code that *exceeds 1000 characters*,it will not be confused because it is *too* large in size.<br>
If you want to obfuscate code that exceeds 1KB, please break it into several parts to obfuscate.<br>
The JSPacker source code comes from [Dean Edwards](http://dean.edwards.name).
